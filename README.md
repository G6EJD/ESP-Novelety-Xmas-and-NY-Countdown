# ESP-Novelety-Xmas-and-NY-Countdown
A countdowntime timer to Xmas and New Year

Starts counting down to Xmas and when Xmas arrives says Merry Xmas and then when New year arrives the message says Happy New Year!

For different Timezones, adjust the defintion at the top of the programme to your Timezone e.g. USA EST -5 or Central Europe 2 then the programme resolves the time differences and adjusts the countdown accordingly.

When both events have happened, that's it, you'll then see 'Happy Xmas' and 'Happy New Year' messages

Merry Charistmas Everyone and a Happy and Peaceful New Year
